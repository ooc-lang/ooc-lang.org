## How to use the documentation

The documentation for ooc is structured as follows:

  1. The [Tutorial](/docs/tutorial/) is a ten minute journey meant for
  newcomers to the language. By building a small program, you will learn the
  basics of the syntax and even use bits of the SDK.

  2. The [Language](/docs/lang/) section explains in detail every feature
  of the language: it goes through the syntax and a the main use cases for
  every feature. It also contains a full grammar, and a collection of best
  practices.

  3. The [SDK](/docs/sdk/) section gives an overview of the modules included
  with the default ooc distribution. Whether you need access to files, to
  measure time, to do some networking, or simply use common data structures,
  the SDK is packed with goodness.

  4. The [Tools](/docs/tools/) section lists useful tools for ooc development,
  along with a typical workflow from the creation, compilation, testing, and
  documentation of a project.

  5. The [Troubleshooting](/docs/kaputt/) section gives advice on how
  to address frequently encountered problems.

  6. The [Glossary](/docs/glossary/) is a collection of terms you may stumble
  upon while using ooc or reading its documentation. If you don't understand
  a term, go here!

When you’re stuck with a question or a problem the documentation doesn’t
solve, considering posting to the [discussion group][group] or joining the
[ooc-lang IRC channel][irc]. We’ll get it sorted out in no time. Check out the
